	comparator -- code for finding common sections in source trees

comparator is a program for rapidly finding common segments in large
source-code trees.  See the manual page for instructions.  It comes
with a filtering postprecessor, filterator.

Besides the production C code, the distribution also includes 
working Python versions.  These were used to prototype the concept.

The document scf-standard.xml describes file interchange formata
